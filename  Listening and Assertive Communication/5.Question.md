### 5. When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

---

I tend to switch to a passive communication style when I feel unsure about expressing my needs or when I want to avoid conflict. For example, if I’m too tired or don’t want to disappoint someone, I might say yes to things I don’t really want to do. I often stay quiet about my own needs, putting others' ahead of mine just to keep the peace, even if it leaves me feeling resentful or stressed later.
