### 6. When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

---
I find myself switching to aggressive communication when I feel overwhelmed, frustrated, or like I’ve been pushed too far. If I’m dealing with someone who’s being too demanding or disrespectful, I might lash out or make sharp, harsh comments. I’ve also noticed that when I feel like I’m not being heard or respected, I can become more forceful or even rude to make my point.
