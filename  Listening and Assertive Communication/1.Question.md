### 1. What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

Here are **6 steps/strategies** to practice **Active Listening** based on the video:

1. **Focus on the Speaker**  
   Pay full attention to the person speaking, blocking out distractions from your own thoughts or surroundings.

2. **Don’t Interrupt**  
   Let the other person finish speaking before you respond. Avoid interrupting, as it shows respect for their thoughts and gives you time to fully process what they're saying.

3. **Use Door Openers**  
   Encourage the speaker to keep talking with phrases like "Tell me more" or "Go on." This shows you’re interested and engaged.

4. **Show You're Listening with Body Language**  
   Nodding, maintaining eye contact, or leaning slightly forward can demonstrate that you're actively engaged in the conversation.

5. **Take Notes**  
   Jot down key points, especially in important conversations, to help you retain the information and show you value what’s being discussed.

6. **Paraphrase What’s Been Said**  
   Repeat back what you’ve heard in your own words to confirm understanding. This ensures you’re on the same page and helps avoid miscommunication.

These steps help ensure you're truly engaged in the conversation and show the speaker that you value their perspective.
