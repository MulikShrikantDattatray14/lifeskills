### 3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?

---
Here are the obstacles I face in my listening process:

1. **Distractions** – I get sidetracked by my own thoughts or the environment around me, which makes it hard to focus.
  
2. **Judging Too Quickly** – Sometimes I jump to conclusions or form opinions before fully hearing the person out.

3. **Interrupting** – I might feel the urge to respond immediately, cutting off the speaker before they've finished.

4. **Not Fully Engaged** – At times, I listen passively without truly processing or trying to understand the speaker’s point.

5. **Emotional Bias** – If I’m upset or stressed, it can cloud my ability to listen objectively.

6. **Multitasking** – Trying to do other things while listening means I'm not giving my full attention to the conversation.

These obstacles can block true understanding, so I need to stay aware of them to improve my listening skills.
