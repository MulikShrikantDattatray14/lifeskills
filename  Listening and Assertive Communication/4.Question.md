### 4. What can you do to improve your listening?

---



Here’s what I can do to improve my listening:

1. **Minimize Distractions** – I’ll put away my phone and focus on the speaker to give them my full attention.

2. **Practice Patience** – I’ll avoid interrupting and let the speaker finish before I respond.

3. **Stay Open-Minded** – I’ll try not to judge or form opinions too quickly and really absorb what’s being said.

4. **Be Present** – I’ll actively engage by nodding, making eye contact, and showing interest in the conversation.

5. **Take Notes** – When the conversation is important, I’ll jot down key points to help me stay focused and remember details.

6. **Ask Clarifying Questions** – If I’m unsure, I’ll ask questions to make sure I understand correctly.

By being more intentional and focused, I can improve my listening and communicate better.
