### 8. How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)

To make my communication more assertive, I could:

- Recognize and name my feelings: I’ll start by clearly identifying how I feel instead of making assumptions or judgments about others.

- State my needs directly: Instead of staying silent or being passive, I’ll practice expressing my needs clearly and respectfully, without apologizing for them.

- Start small: I’ll apply assertive communication in low-stakes situations, like asking for something simple at a store, to build confidence.

- Be aware of my body language: I’ll make sure my tone and body language match my words so I don't accidentally come off as aggressive or passive.

- Set boundaries early: I’ll speak up early in relationships or situations to set clear expectations, so I don’t end up feeling overburdened or taken advantage of.

- By practicing these steps, I can communicate more confidently, get my needs met, and maintain healthier relationships without feeling guilty or overly aggressive.
