### 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)



---
According to Fisher's model, **Reflective Listening** focuses on understanding and responding to someone in a way that shows you are actively trying to grasp their feelings and message. Here are the key points:

1. **Listen Carefully**  
   Pay close attention to what the person is saying. Don't rush to respond or get distracted by your own thoughts.

2. **Reflect Emotions**  
   Acknowledge the feelings behind the words. For example, if someone is upset, reflect that back by saying, "You seem frustrated."

3. **Paraphrase and Clarify**  
   Repeat what the person said in your own words to show that you understand. For example, "So you're saying that you felt ignored in the meeting?"

4. **Ask Questions for Clarity**  
   If something is unclear, ask gentle questions to get a better understanding. This shows you care about getting the full picture.

5. **Avoid Judging or Interrupting**  
   Don't criticize or interrupt while they are speaking. Let them finish what they need to say before offering your thoughts.

6. **Give Feedback**  
   After reflecting their feelings and message, offer a response that shows you've heard and understood, but avoid giving solutions unless they ask.

Reflective listening helps create a safe space for the speaker to express themselves and feel understood. It's about building trust and communication, not just hearing words but really connecting with the speakerâ€™s emotions and thoughts.
