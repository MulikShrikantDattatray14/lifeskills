### 7. When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

---

I sometimes slip into passive-aggressive communication when I’m frustrated but don’t feel comfortable expressing my feelings directly. For example, I might use sarcasm to mask my true emotions or give someone the silent treatment when I’m upset. I’ve also caught myself gossiping or making subtle comments rather than talking openly about what’s bothering me. It's usually when I feel like my needs won’t be taken seriously, so I indirectly express my anger or discomfort.
