# 4. Mindset - A MountBlue Warrior Reference Manual #

### What are your ideas to take action and build Growth Mindset? ###


---

### 1. **Own My Learning**
I take full responsibility for my learning. If I don’t know something, I figure it out myself, and if I don’t understand it fully, I keep going until I do.

### 2. **Stick With Problems**
I won’t quit when something’s tough. I’ll stay with the problem, no matter how confusing or uncomfortable it gets. I know that’s where growth happens.

### 3. **Put In The Effort**
The more I put in, the more I get out. I make time to practice and keep pushing, even when it’s hard. Growth takes time.

### 4. **Understand Before I Act**
Before I write code or solve a problem, I make sure I understand the concept behind it. If something’s unclear, I look it up until I get it.

### 5. **Learn From Mistakes**
When things go wrong, I don’t get frustrated. I see mistakes as clues to help me improve. Confusion and errors mean I’m learning.

### 6. **Stay Calm and Positive**
I stay focused and calm when things get tough. Discomfort is just part of the process, and I know I can handle it.

### 7. **Be Resourceful**
Before asking for help, I check documentation, Google, and online forums. It’s important to try solving things on my own first.

### 8. **Embrace Discomfort**
I don’t run from discomfort. I understand that it’s part of the learning process and helps me grow stronger and smarter.

### 9. **Aim for Excellence**
I strive for mastery in everything I do. My code (or work) should be functional, readable, modular, and efficient. I always give my best.

### 10. **Surround Myself With Growth**
I choose to be around people who encourage growth. I learn from others and share my own journey. We help each other get better.

### 11. **Follow a Clear Process**
When I face a problem, I take it step by step: Relax, Focus, Understand, Code, Repeat. I stay patient and methodical until I find the solution.

### 12. **Celebrate Progress**
I acknowledge my wins, even the small ones. Every step forward matters, and celebrating them keeps me motivated to keep going.
