# 3. Understanding Internal Locus of Control #

### What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video? ###

---


The *Internal Locus of Control* refers to the belief that you have control over the outcomes of your life through your own actions, efforts, and decisions. People with this mindset believe that their success or failure is primarily determined by their own behavior, rather than external factors like luck or circumstances.

The key point in the video is that having an internal locus of control is crucial for staying motivated. When individuals believe they are in control of their actions and outcomes, they are more likely to put in the effort, embrace challenges, and persevere, which ultimately leads to higher motivation and success. Conversely, those with an external locus of control, who attribute outcomes to external factors, are less likely to stay motivated or put in sustained effort.
