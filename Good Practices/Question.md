**Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?**


The point about using tools like Loom, CodePen, and GitHub gists to share code snippets and visual explanations was new to me. These tools help in clearly communicating technical issues with the team..

**Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**


I need to improve on over-communication, especially when unexpected delays occur. To improve, I will ensure I communicate any changes in deadlines, issues, or delays early to my team and prefer using group chats for better visibility.
