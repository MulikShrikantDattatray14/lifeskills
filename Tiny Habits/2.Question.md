# 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

BJ Fogg’s formula for building new habits is **B = MAP**, which stands for:

- **B** = **Behavior** (the new habit you want to do)
- **M** = **Motivation** (how much energy or drive you have to do the habit)
- **A** = **Ability** (how easy or hard the habit is to do)
- **P** = **Prompt** (something that reminds you to do it)

To make building new habits easier, you need to get the right balance between these three things. Here’s how:

### 1. **Motivation (M)**
Motivation is the energy you have to do something. But here’s the trick: don’t rely on motivation too much! Motivation can be high some days and low other days, so to make a new habit stick, you need to make it **easy enough** that you don’t need tons of motivation to do it. 

**Example:**  
Instead of trying to meditate for 20 minutes, just aim for 1 deep breath. That’s super easy, and even if you’re tired or not in the mood, it’s simple enough that you can still do it.

### 2. **Ability (A)**
Ability is how easy or hard it is to actually do the habit. If something is too hard, you’ll need a lot of motivation to push through. So, make the habit **as small and simple as possible**.

**Example:**  
Want to work out more? Instead of setting a big goal like “work out for 30 minutes,” start with something small like “do 1 push-up” or “stretch for 30 seconds.” When it’s that easy, you’ll actually want to do it more often.

### 3. **Prompt (P)**
A prompt is the reminder that tells you when to do the habit. The best way to remember to do your new habit is to link it to something you already do every day. This way, the new habit flows naturally from an existing habit, and you don’t need to think about it much.

**Example:**  
You could say, “After I brush my teeth, I’ll do one push-up.” Brushing your teeth is already a habit, so after that action, it’ll be easy to do your new habit right after it.

### So, how do you make new habits stick?

1. **Start small:** Break your new habit into a tiny version that’s super easy to do.
2. **Use a prompt:** Link the new habit to something you already do, so you don’t forget.
3. **Celebrate your success:** After doing the tiny habit, take a moment to feel proud, even if it’s just one push-up or one deep breath. That feeling of success will help you build momentum to do more.

By making your new habits small and simple, tying them to things you already do, and celebrating each small win, you’ll find it much easier to stick with new habits over time.
