**Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**  


One habit I’d like to do more of is reading. I love reading, but sometimes I struggle to make time for it. To make it easier and more attractive, I can start by setting a specific time each day to read, like right before bed or in the morning with a cup of coffee. I could also keep a book nearby, so it's always in sight and easy to grab. To make it more satisfying, I could choose books that really excite me, so I look forward to reading instead of forcing myself to do it.

**Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**  


A habit I’d like to do less of is mindlessly scrolling on my phone. It's easy to get caught up in it, but I know it wastes time. To make it harder, I can put my phone on "Do Not Disturb" mode or leave it in another room when I'm working or relaxing. I could also make the phone less attractive by removing distracting apps or turning off notifications. To make the response unsatisfying, I could set a timer for how long I allow myself to use certain apps, so I feel less tempted to keep scrolling once the time is up.
