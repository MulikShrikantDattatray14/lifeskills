###  Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

It’s important to **“Shine”** or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit because this feeling of success **reinforces** the behavior and builds positive momentum. BJ Fogg calls this feeling **“shine”**, which is like an authentic sense of pride or accomplishment. Even if it’s just completing a tiny habit, like doing one push-up or taking one deep breath, celebrating it helps your brain associate that action with something positive.

By celebrating your tiny wins, you create **success momentum**—a snowball effect where each small success increases your motivation to do it again. This is crucial because the more you feel successful, the more likely you are to continue performing the habit. Fogg compares it to giving yourself a reward, like a treat after training a dog. It’s not about the size of the achievement, but the **frequency of your successes** that matters.

Celebrating builds confidence and encourages you to **stick with** the habit, no matter how small it seems. Over time, those tiny habits grow, and you’ll find yourself doing more and more without needing to rely on high motivation. Essentially, **whatever you celebrate, you’ll keep doing**—this is why celebrating your tiny victories is the secret to creating lasting habits.
