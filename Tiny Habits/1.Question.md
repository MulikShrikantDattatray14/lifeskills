The most interesting idea from the video is the concept of "shine." It’s about celebrating small wins, even if they’re tiny, like doing one push-up or flossing one tooth. Fogg explains that when you feel proud after completing a small habit, it gives you a boost of motivation and helps you keep going. 

This is really powerful because instead of waiting for big achievements to feel good, you can build confidence by celebrating the little things. That sense of pride, or "shine," creates momentum, making it easier to stick with new habits and gradually turn them into bigger ones.

It’s a simple but effective way to build habits: focus on small actions, celebrate them, and let those little victories snowball into bigger ones. It’s less about pushing yourself to do huge things and more about making small, steady progress—and enjoying it along the way.
