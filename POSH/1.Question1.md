### 1. What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can take many forms, each of them disruptive and deeply uncomfortable for those affected. It's not just about “big” actions; sometimes, it’s small, persistent behaviors that create a hostile and unsafe atmosphere. Here’s how these behaviors break down:

   - **Verbal Harassment**: This includes any unwanted comments about someone’s looks, crude jokes, personal questions, or repeated advances. Even things that might seem “light-hearted” can make someone feel objectified or vulnerable, especially when they’re out of place in a work setting. These comments pile up, chipping away at a person’s comfort and peace.

   - **Visual Harassment**: Imagine walking by a desk every day only to see explicit or suggestive images or getting emails that feel inappropriate. These “small” actions can be deeply unsettling and create an environment where it’s hard to feel respected and safe.

   - **Physical Harassment**: When someone touches you without permission, blocks your path, or stands too close, it’s easy to feel trapped or even frightened. Boundaries in the workplace matter because they’re a form of respect. Physical harassment crosses these boundaries, making the individual feel exposed and vulnerable.

   There are also two specific types of harassment that are especially harmful:

   - **Quid Pro Quo (This for That)**: When someone in a position of power suggests that keeping your job or advancing in it depends on personal favors, it’s a huge misuse of power. This isn’t just harassment; it’s a betrayal of trust, leaving the victim feeling cornered and helpless.

   - **Hostile Work Environment**: Sometimes, it’s the accumulation of ongoing, unwanted behaviors that make a workplace feel unbearable. The person affected might feel isolated or on edge, dreading the thought of going to work. This toxic environment can drain a person’s confidence and sense of safety.
