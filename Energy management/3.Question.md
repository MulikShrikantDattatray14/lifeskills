### Question 3: How do you understand if you are in the Excitement quadrant?

I can tell I’m in the Excitement quadrant when I feel a burst of energy and a sense of enthusiasm about something. It’s like there’s a spark inside me, and I can’t wait to dive into whatever is ahead. I might get a little restless, feeling like I want to do everything at once, and I feel really motivated to take on new challenges. My mind starts buzzing with ideas, and I find myself looking forward to what's coming up, whether it’s a new project, an event, or even a chance to learn something new. It’s that positive, high-energy feeling where everything seems exciting and full of possibilities.
