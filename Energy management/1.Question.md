### Question 1: What are the activities you do that make you relax - Calm quadrant?

---
When I want to relax and find some calm, I usually do things that help me slow down and unwind. For me, it could be something as simple as taking a walk in nature, where I can just breathe and let go of any stress. I also enjoy reading a good book, especially something light or inspiring, because it helps me shift my focus away from worries. Listening to calming music or doing some light stretches or yoga also helps me feel more centered. Sometimes, just sitting quietly and focusing on my breath for a few minutes can bring me back to that peaceful, calm space. Itâ€™s all about giving myself space to pause and reset.
