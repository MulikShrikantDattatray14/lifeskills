### Question 6: Paraphrase the video - Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise.

1. **Immediate Brain Benefits:** Exercise boosts mood, focus, and attention right after a workout by releasing neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, improving mental clarity for at least two hours.
2. **Long-term Cognitive Gains:** Regular exercise increases the volume of the hippocampus, which improves long-term memory, and strengthens the prefrontal cortex, enhancing attention and decision-making.
3. **Protects the Brain:** Exercise has protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia by strengthening critical brain areas, making them more resilient to aging and cognitive decline.
4. **Neurogenesis:** Physical activity encourages the creation of new brain cells, particularly in the hippocampus, improving memory retention and overall brain health.
5. **Accessible and Free:** You don’t need to be a professional athlete; just three to four sessions of moderate aerobic exercise a week, like walking or taking the stairs, can have profound brain benefits.

### Question 7: What are some steps you can take to exercise more?

1. **Start small and gradually increase intensity** – Begin with short sessions, like a 30-minute walk, and work your way up.
2. **Exercise consistently** – Aim for 3-4 days a week of aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, jogging, or cycling.
3. **Incorporate movement into daily tasks** – Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk around the block, or engage in activities like power-vacuuming.
4. **Join an exercise class or find a workout buddy** – Socialize while exercising to make it more enjoyable and motivating.
5. **Set achievable goals** – Focus on short-term goals like improving your stamina or increasing your workout frequency to stay motivated.
