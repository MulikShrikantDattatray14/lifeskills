### Question 2: When do you find getting into the Stress quadrant?


I find myself slipping into the Stress quadrant when I feel overwhelmed by too many things happening at once. It usually happens when I have a lot of tasks piling up or when I'm facing tight deadlines. If I'm juggling multiple responsibilities, like work, personal errands, or commitments, I start to feel pressure building up. Also, when I'm not able to fully control a situation, or when things feel unpredictable, my stress levels go up. It’s like my mind starts racing, and I feel like I can’t keep up with everything. That’s when I know I’ve entered the Stress quadrant—when things feel urgent and out of balance.
