### Question 4: Paraphrase of "Sleep is Your Superpower" video

- Sleep deprivation causes significant physical and cognitive impairments, including aging effects on reproductive health, such as smaller testicles and reduced testosterone in men.
- Sleep is crucial for memory; it helps consolidate learning and prepares the brain for new information. Without sleep, memory circuits become ineffective.
- Studies show that a single night of sleep deprivation severely hampers learning ability (a 40% deficit in memory retention).
- Sleep restores memory through deep sleep brainwaves and sleep spindles, transferring memories to long-term storage.
- Poor sleep quality is linked to aging and cognitive decline, including Alzheimer’s disease, but improving sleep could reverse some damage.
- Sleep deprivation increases risks for heart attacks, car crashes, immune deficiency, cancer, and even accelerates aging at a genetic level.
- Short sleep durations lead to weakened immune function, raising cancer risk and causing significant changes in gene activity.
- Regular sleep and a cool, dark environment are essential for good sleep quality.
- Sleep is a biological necessity, not a luxury, and its decline is a public health crisis affecting well-being, safety, and education.

- Keep your bedroom cool (around 65°F or 18°C) to help lower your body temperature and initiate sleep.
- Avoid caffeine and alcohol, especially in the hours leading up to bedtime.
- Avoid naps during the day if you're struggling with nighttime sleep.
- If unable to fall asleep, get out of bed and do something relaxing in another room until you feel sleepy.
- Create a consistent, relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it’s time to wind down.
