**1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique**
   
The Feynman Technique is a way to learn by breaking down complex ideas into simple explanations, as if teaching someone new to the topic.

**2. What was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
The most interesting story in the video was about Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison. Both used a creative technique to help spark ideas, holding objects like keys or ball bearings while they relaxed. As they started to drift to sleep, the objects would fall and wake them up, allowing them to capture insights from their diffuse mode of thinking, where their minds were open to new ideas, and bring them into focused, productive work.

**3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**  
Active and diffused modes of thinking refer to two different mental states used in learning. The *active mode* (or focus mode) involves concentrated, intense focus on a task, using familiar neural pathways. The *diffuse mode* is a more relaxed state where the mind freely explores and connects new ideas, often uncovering creative solutions by thinking broadly. Effective learning often involves switching between these two modes.

**4. What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points?**

1. **Deconstruct the skill**: Break down the skill into smaller, manageable parts. Focus on practicing the most essential components first to make quick progress.

2. **Learn enough to self-correct**: Gather a few reliable resources to learn the basics. Aim to know just enough to recognize and correct your own mistakes while practicing.

3. **Remove barriers to practice**: Minimize distractions (e.g., internet, TV) and create an environment that encourages focused practice.

4. **Practice for at least 20 hours**: Commit to practicing for 20 hours to push through the initial frustration barrier and make substantial improvement.

**5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

To improve my learning process, here’s what I’ll focus on:

1. **Break It Down**: I’ll simplify what I want to learn by dividing it into smaller, essential parts. I’ll start with the basics that bring the biggest results.

2. **Set Clear Goals**: I’ll define what I want to achieve, like being able to have a basic conversation in a new language. This will keep me focused and motivated.

3. **Practice Actively**: I’ll quiz myself regularly to strengthen memory, using techniques like spaced repetition to help new information stick.

4. **Remove Distractions**: I’ll set up a distraction-free environment—maybe turn off notifications and dedicate specific time slots for learning.

5. **Focus on Essentials (80/20 Rule)**: I’ll concentrate on the parts of the skill that have the most impact, making my learning more efficient and meaningful.
